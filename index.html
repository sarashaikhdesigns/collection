        <div>
          <p>
            forget me not,
            in streets 
                         where metal 
                      and glass rise,
            she still finds a way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            breaking cracks,
            quiet, 
              unnoticed, 
                  but alive;
        if you lean in close,
                 you can see her.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            in violets,
            tucked against a fence,
                        roses,
            wilting in the window,
            petals touched 
                   by city grime.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            clinging 
            to her colors
            to her brief 
                        moment of time,
            there’s something fragile
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            in the way,
            she holds space
            in a city 
                too fast to notice;
                          i stare, 
            memorizing her outline.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            as if 
            by looking long enough,
            i could keep her colors
            from fading 
              into the rush of days.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
                      will the pages of a book 
                      preserve her?
          the way 
          the sun catches a petal,
          the way 
          a scent lingers in the air
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            brief, like 
            memory of a season
            you almost forgot,
                until it returns.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            in the quiet corners,
            where she fights for light,
            i feel the weight of her 
                          in my hands: 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
                        how everything 
                    moves, 
                        changes,
            and yet, 
            here she is—
                        blooming, 
            even when no one sees.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            and i wonder 
            how much of myself
            i’ve left 
            scattered 
                   like 
                       this,
            in fragments 
            across 	   this 	   city.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            but flowers don’t mind.
            they open, 
            they close,
            they disappear.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            as if 
            that’s enough.
       as if 
            that’s everything.
       if you could be still,
       for a moment,   
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            watch her fill 
            the 
              space 
                   she’s 
                      given.
            and it is enough.
            and she is everything. 
            
          </p>
