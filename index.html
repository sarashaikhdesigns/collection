welcome viewer,

    i’m so glad you’ve found your way to my website for my project, "forget-me-not." 
this project was born out of my love for the quiet beauty that thrives within the 
landscape of new york city. through this project, i’ve gathered 50 total flowers 
from various areas across the city to document and explore their subtle presence. 

if you navigate to the flashing flower icon, you can go one step further and create 
your own art inspired by my collection. on this drawing page, where you can click 
to place the flowers into your own unique art. once you’re finished, you can
download your artwork and share it. i hope that this will serve as a small, personal 
reminder of the beauty and life that nature brings to our world.
                    
thank you for taking a moment to reflect, create, and to not forget the beauty that 
surrounds us, even in the heart of the city.

warmly,
sara <3
